PyDATA

PyDATA is a package for working and manipulating data files. I have been using some of these scripts for a while and though it would be a good idea to package them together so other people can use them. I am still working on this package. Individual files should be ready to use. Feel free to post your feature requests on the wiki page. 

This package will contain scripts for importing and exporting different data types.
These types include:

  - Matlab .mat file (done)
  - Columnar data files
  - csv files
  - R dataframes
  - Excel .xls files
